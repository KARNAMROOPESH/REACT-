        Today we are releasing React 16.13.0. It contains bugfixes and new deprecation warnings to help prepare for a future major release.
        
        New Warnings
        Warnings for some updates during render
        A React component should not cause side effects in other components during rendering.
        
        It is supported to call setState during render, but only for the same component. If you call setState during a render on a different component, you will now see a warning:
        
        Warning: Cannot update a component from inside the function body of a different component.
        This warning will help you find application bugs caused by unintentional state changes. In the rare case that you intentionally want to change the state of another component as a result of rendering, you can wrap the setState call into useEffect.
        
        Warnings for conflicting style rules
        When dynamically applying a style that contains longhand and shorthand versions of CSS properties, particular combinations of updates can cause inconsistent styling. For example:
        </big></p>
       </p>
        </div>
    </body>
